# MTGEngine

> A simple Magic the Gathering engine, acting a base for some other project ideas

The idea for this project came from an idea to experiment with modern, state of the art machine learning algorithms in combination with MTG. 
With Neural-Network Game-AIs becoming stronger and stronger, it might be interesting to see how such AIs perform in non-deterministic games
such as MTG. Research in this area exists, but most of it does not consider state-of-the-art algorithms and is quite niche in general.

For this reason, we decided that we need a performant MTG-Engine with a language-agnostic interface. This project aims to be just that.

Due to this interface, we should also be able to extend this engine to a fully playable MTG-Client on a later occasion
